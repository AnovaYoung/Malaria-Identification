**Problem Statement:**

Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease that places a significant burden on global health, particularly in resource-limited regions.
Traditional diagnosis methods can be time-consuming and require specialized expertise.

**Project Goal:**

This project develops an automated malaria detection system using deep learning and neural network models that aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, supporting faster treatment and potentially reducing mortality.
